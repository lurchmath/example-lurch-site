# Lurch

This repository is becoming the central location for the latest version of the Lurch project.
The migration from three other repositories into this one has completed,
which makes it much easier for our code to work together, but there is still some
cleanup of the merged code to be done.

One part of that cleanup will be to put a better README file here, but for now,
if you want to learn more about the project, you should just
[check out the website, here](http://lurchmath.github.io).
