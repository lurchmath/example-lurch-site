 * A subclass of {@link FileSystem} that represents browsing and downloading

 * 
 * In fact, only one method is supported, {@link WebSystem#open open()}, the
 * details of which are documented below.  Technically, we could also implement

 * subsumed under {@link WebSystem#open open()} in this class.

 * Warning:  CORS policies on most websites severely restrict the ability of a
 * website to load content from another website.  So providing a URL that lets a
 * student load a Lurch document from the web is very hard to do unless you
 * control the website that's hosting the file and you can set the CORS policy
 * to permit the Lurch app to fetch your file.  An easier way to handle this is
 * to check out a copy of the Lurch repo onto your web server and host the app
 * yourself, so that when you provide URLs to your students, they are going to
 * the same website as the app, and thus no CORS policies come into play.

     * enormous number of web pages and this app cannot know them all.
     * Therefore, this file system needs a different UI than the one the parent
     * class provides.
     * 
     * Here, we provide three ways for a user to transfer a file from the web
     * into this app.  This function returns a collection of dialog items that 
     * provide such functionality, as follows.
     * 
     *  - One dialog item is a text box into which the user can type the URL of
     *    a file on the web.  A note appears beneath this blank pointing out
     *    that many websites on the Internet do not allow for cross-site file
     *    transfer, so beware that this has limited applicability.
     *  - If the user enters a file into that blank and chooses to fetch it, the
     *    app will do so, and if it finds that the result is a Lurch document,
     *    it will be opened in the app.  However, if it finds that the result is
     *    not a Lurch document, it will be treated as a collection of links to
     *    be shown to the user like a folder for browsing.  The user can click
     *    any such link to follow it and browse the resulting "folder," etc.
     *    This allows instructors to set up nested collections of Lurch
     *    documents, organized into folders, on a website, just by writing tiny
     *    web pages with links in them (or allowing the web server to
     *    auto-generate the folder lists as pages, which many servers do).
     *  - The second dialog item, below the first, is a list of bookmarks.  When
     *    a user is browsing any "folder" in the sense defined above, they can
     *    mark it as a bookmark to add it to this list.  Each bookmark will also
     *    have an "unbookmark this" button when visiting it.  This is so that a
     *    student user can visit the webpage for a course's Lurch documents,
     *    bookmark it, and never need to enter the URL again.  The instructor
     *    may even update the content throughout the semester, and the user will
     *    always have it bookmarked.
     * 
     * If the user chooses a document, when this function calls the
     * `selectFile()` method in the dialog, it will pass a file object with its
     * file contents loaded, and the caller will not need to fetch the data
     * itself.
     * 
     * @returns {Object[]} an array of dialog items representing the UI
     *   described above
