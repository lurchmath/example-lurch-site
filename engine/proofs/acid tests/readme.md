## Acid Tests

The examples in this folder with names of the form 'acid*' come from a markdown
document that the original Lurch team (Ken and Nathan) had shared with
particularly challenging natural deduction edge cases in it.  Some are meant to
be valid and others are counterexamples that try to violate rule restrictions.

There are also other test files that are included in this folder to check other
features of the deductive engine as they have been added.
