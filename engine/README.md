# The Lurch validation engine

This subfolder is for the Lurch validation engine, currently called the
$n$-compact validation algorithm.  It includes several other tools that were
developed at the same time by the same developer (Ken Monks), including the Lode
command-line tool, parsing tools to convert amongst languages used in the new
Lurch app, and a suite of tests for the validation algorithm.

Other folders in this repository include code for the user interface and for the
core classes and data structures.

Not all code and comments in this repository are 100% up-to-date; some are in
the process of being updated as we clean up from a major reorganization of our
codebase.
