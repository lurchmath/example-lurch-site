# Mathematical documents folder

If you make a copy of this repository to use as the basis for your own Lurch
Site, you can fill this folder with the relevant mathematical documents for your
site.

By default, it is empty, because this is the development repository.  It is not
the repository for any instructor's Lurch Site, but rather the repository where
we build the app itself.
