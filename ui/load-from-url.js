/**
 * Check to see if the query string for the current page contains an instruction
 * for loading a file.  This can be in one of two formats.
 * 
 * If the query string contains a "load=..." parameter, treat its value as
 * either an URL (and try to load a Lurch document from that URL) or a filename
 * in the browser's local storage (and try to load a Lurch document from there).
 * Place the document in the given editor on success, and report an error with a
 * notification on failure.  The priority for how to treat the parameter is as
 * follows.
 * 
 *  1. If it is a file in the user's browser's local storage, load it and stop.
 *  1. If it is a valid URL, load it and stop.
 *  1. Try treating it as a relative URL and use the current page's URL as the
 *     base from which to make it into an absolute URL.  If that produced a
 *     valid absolute URL, load it and stop.
 *  1. Give up with an error notification.
 * 
 * If the query string contains a "data=..." parameter, treat its value as the
 * base-64 encoding of a document.  Decode it into a string containing HTML, and
 * load that document into the given editor.
 * 
 * If the query string has both parameters (which it should not), the "load=..."
 * parameter takes precedence and the "data=..." parameter is ignored.
 *

 *   load the document specified in the query string, if there is one
