/**
 * This module provides an `install()` function for use in the editor's setup
 * routine.  It takes action if and only if we detect that this instance of the
 * Lurch application is embedded in an iframe, and is thus not a top-level app
 * intended for users to edit, but an app that is being used in some other
 * context (e.g., documentation, blog, online book, etc.) where the author of
 * that site will be providing the application's document content, probably as
 * an example for the reader to view (and optionally edit).  See the
 * documentation below for the {@link module:EmbedListener.install install()}
 * function to learn more about its behavior.
 * 
 * To make it easy for users to embed Lurch documents in an external page, we
 * provide some handy notation, so that they do not need to write the intricate
 * HTML content that is the actual representation of atoms and shells in the
 * TinyMCE editor when Lurch is running.  (That would be far too complex for a
 * human author.)  Instead, they can use one of the following two notations.
 * 
 * ## HTML Notation
 * 
 * Ordinary HTML, plus the following extra tags:
 * 
 *  - `<lurch>...</lurch>`, which should contain a single piece of text in Lurch
 *    notation, and will be replaced with an {@link Expression} atom that
 *    contains that notation (in advanced mode).
 *  - `<latex>...</latex>`, which should contain a single piece of LaTeX code,
 *    and will be replaced with an {@link ExpositoryMath} atom containing the
 *    same LaTeX code.
 *  - `<theorem>...</theorem>`, `<proof>...</proof>`, and so on, one for every
 *    type of {@link Shell} subclass that has been registered with the app, and
 *    which will be converted into a shell of that subclass, containing whatever
 *    is placed inside of the opening and closing tags.
 * 
 * ## Markdown Notation
 * 
 * Ordinary Markdown, plus the following extra features:
 * 
 *  - Any text containing `$...$` will be replaced with a `<latex>...</latex>`
 *    tag containing the same content, and then processed as in HTML mode, as
 *    defined above.
 *  - Any inline code block encosed in backticks will be replaced with a
 *    `<lurch>...</lurch>` tag containing the same code, which should therefore
 *    be in Lurch notation, and will then be processed as in HTML mode, as
 *    defined above.
 *  - Any blockquote section (each line beginning with `>`) will be replaced
 *    by a `<proof>...</proof>` tag containing the contents of the blockquote,
 *    or a `<subproof>...</subproof>` tag instead if it is an inner blockquote
 *    (that is, one with a blockquote ancestor).
 * 
 * To make it easy for the outer page to define where copies of the Lurch app
 * should appear, and what they should contain, we provide a script you can
 * import into that outer page, which will do the job automatically.  See
 * {@link module:EmbedScript the embedded.js script} for details.
 * 
 * ## Document headers
 * 
 * As you write a Lurch document, you may want some content to be placed into
 * its document header.  For example, you may want some axioms or rules of
 * inference to be stored there so that they are usable in the document, without
 * taking up space in that document.
 * 
 * In both Markdown and HTML formats, the user can create a DIV with the class
 * "header" to mark a portion of the document as the header.  That is, write
 * `<div class="header">`, followed by the contents of the header (over the
 * course of as many paragraphs as needed), followed by the closing `</div>`.
 *

/**
 * This function should be called on the TinyMCE's editor during its setup

 * page to be able to send a document to this editor for it to load.
 * 
 *  - Send a message to the top-level window saying that it's ready to receive
 *    data from the containing page, to populate the editor with.
 *  - Install an event handler for messages from the top-level window that
 *    expects the document to be shown in the editor.  When that document comes,
 *    it will be decoded from HTML or Markdown form, which includes interpreting
 *    any of the handy codes inside that HTML or Markdown into their correct
 *    form for inclusion in the app, as documented below.
 *  - If the user requests that the document be validated after it is shown, we
 *    queue up a validation action as well.
