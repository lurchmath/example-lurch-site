/**
 * @file The Lurch command-line interface (CLI)
 * 
 * You can run this module from the command line via `node cli.js` (if you're in
 * this folder, or with a different path if you're elsewhere), passing arguments
 * as documented below.  There are several use cases for this command-line
 * interface.
 * 
 * **NOTE:** If you do not have Chromium installed so that the puppeteer module
 * can find it, this CLI will not work.  If you are using the development
 * container for this repository as defined in
 * {@link https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch/blob/master/.devcontainer/Dockerfile
 * its Dockerfile}, Chromium is already installed for you.
 * 
 * ## Use case 1: Writing Lurch documents in Markdown
 * 
 * Some users prefer to write documents in Markdown, for (some subset of) the
 * following reasons.
 * 
 *  * They want to be able to edit the document in a text editor
 *  * They type more quickly when they do not need to use menu items or dialog
 *    boxes to insert their content
 *  * They want to check their source documents into version control in an easy,
 *    human-readable format
 * 
 * In addition, this command-line interface makes it easy to import one file
 * into another as a dependency, which is a feature that (at the time this tool
 * was invented, February 2024) has only partial support in the full Lurch web
 * application.  (One can embed dependencies, but cannot recursively refresh
 * them when the dependencies change.)  For that reason, this tool has some
 * temporary benefits that the full Lurch app does not have.
 * 
 * To use the CLI in this way, just run it on a single input file, which can be
 * a markdown file (ending in `.md`) or an HTML file (ending in `.html`) in
 * either of two formats (simplified HTML or long-form HTML, described below).
 * 
 * `node cli.js path/to/your-file.md`
 * 
 * This mode will convert your file into standard Lurch form, load it into an
 * invisible copy of the full Lurch web app running in a headless Chromium
 * browser, validate the document, and then print to the console the results of
 * that validation process, indented in a way that mimics the structure of
 * nested environments in your document.  Here is an example, without any of
 * the colors that are used in the actual terminal output:
 * 
 * ```
 *     rule:
 *         expression: `Assume A and B`
 *         expression: `A`
 *         expression: `B`
 *     expression: `Assume X and Y`
 *     expression: `Y`                       âœ“ valid 
 *     expression: `Z`                       ? indeterminate 
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Other output formats
 * 
 * If you do not want the output in this human-readable, simple, text form, you
 * can ask for HTML output instead, which shows the long-form HTML that is
 * stored in the actual Lurch app editor.  Do so with the following command:
 * 
 * `node cli.js --html path/to/your-file.md`
 * 
 * This type of output is suitable for redirecting to an `.html` file that can
 * then be opened by the main Lurch app.  It will include the results of
 * validation, but if you want the HTML without the validation results, use the
 * `--html-only` switch instead of `--html`.  For example, to redirect to an
 * HTML file and exclude validation results, use the following form.
 * 
 * `node cli.js --html-only path/to/your-file.md > output-file.html`
 * 
 * If you would like to create a readable representation of the document for a
 * non-technical audience, you can output to PDF.  This mode of the CLI will
 * automatically save the file into the same location as the input file, but
 * with a `.pdf` extension.  The PDF is just a direct capture of the Lurch app
 * running in the headless Chromium, with your document loaded and validated.
 * 
 * `node cli.js --pdf path/to/your-file.md`
 * 
 * ## Simplified HTML vs. long-form HTML
 * 
 * Writing a Lurch document typically includes mathematical content like
 * theorems, proofs, expressions, etc.  In the main Lurch app, these are stored
 * as complex HTML tags that are appropriate for rendering and editing by the
 * Lurch app, but are not human-readable nor easy to create.  To make it easier
 * to create such content, we have the concept of "simplified HTML," which means
 * that we provide simple HTML tags with common mathematical meanings, that can
 * be programmatically converted on your behalf into the more complex format
 * that the app uses internally.
 * 
 * Specifically, if you view {@link module:EmbedListener the module supporting
 * embedded copies of the Lurch app,} its documentation describes how one can
 * write tags of the form `<lurch>...</lurch>`, `<latex>...</latex>`,
 * `<theorem>...</theorem>`, and others that represent meaningful mathematics in
 * a compact way.  Those tags are supported in both HTML and Markdown inputs to
 * the CLI.  Just as that documentation page describes support for the document
 * header using a DIV of class "header," the CLI supports that as well.
 * 
 * That documentation also points out that, in Markdown input, the user can use
 * inline Markdown code (surrounded in backticks) to represent expressions in
 * Lurch notation, and can use inline LaTeX code (surrounded in dollar signs)
 * to represent expository mathematics (that is, mathematics that is to be
 * typeset and displayed, but not interpreted as part of the user's proof).
 * 
 * To see example Lurch documents written in Markdown using these conventions,
 * refer to {@link https://github.com/lurchmath/lurchmath.github.io/tree/master/docs
 * the source code for our documentation,} which includes many tutorial pages
 * with embedded copies of Lurch, each of which has its own document written in
 * Markdown.
 * 
 * In addition to the features document on that page, the CLI also supports
 * importing other documents into the one being processed by the CLI.  Use an
 * HTML tag of the form `<import src="relative path"/>` to do so.  Imports can
 * be recursive, and circular dependency chains generate errors.  It is common
 * to place such "import" tags in the document header, as described above, in a
 * form that looks like the following.
 * 
 * ```html
 * <div class="header">
 *     <import src="path/to/some-import.md"/>
 *     <import src="path/to/another-import.md"/>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Use case 2: Validating existing Lurch documents
 * 
 * It is unlikely that the user will want to author documents in the long-form
 * HTML format, because it is an internal storage format that is far less
 * human-readable.  But if the user already has a Lurch document saved from the
 * app itself, and thus in the long-form HTML format, you can pass it to the CLI
 * to have it validated.
 * 
 * `node cli.js path/to/your-file.html`
 * 
 * The output is the same as when Markdown input is given; it will be indented
 * text output of the validation results.  To instead see the output as HTML,
 * so that you could use it to replace the original document, for example, use
 * the `--html` switch mentioned earlier.
 * 
 * ## Use case 3: Validating an entire folder
 * 
 * If you run the command on a folder instead of a single file, the CLI will
 * validate all the files in that folder, and print the results to the console.
 * In this mode, you can use only the default output format (indented text, as
 * shown above), which will be supplemented with a filename above each section
 * of output.  (The HTML output forms are typically for redirecting to a file,
 * and thus do not make sense in this context.)
 * 
 * `node cli.js path/to/your-folder`
 * 
 * ## Use case 4: Watching for changes
 * 
 * If you run the command on a folder, you can pass the `--watch` switch to
 * tell the CLI not to immediately process all the files in the folder, but to
 * watch for changes to the folder itself.  The CLI will respond whenever a file
 * is added to the folder or when the contents of a file change; in each case,
 * it will read the new or changed file and process it in the default way
 * described above (printing validation results in text form, indented).
 * 
 * In this mode, the CLI does not exit until the user kills the process.  It
 * remains running so that you can use it to get constant, up-to-the-moment
 * feedback on your recently saved edits.  You can exit it with Ctrl+C, as with
 * any CLI tool.
 * 
 * The `--watch` switch is not compatible with the `--html` or `--html-only`
 * switches because their output is not human-readable, and the goal of the
 * `--watch` switch is to provide a way for the user to edit a document and,
 * each time they save, see the latest validation results.  Thus the only output
 * format that makes sense is the default one.
 * 
 * `node cli.js --watch path/to/your-folder`
 * 
 * ## Use case 5: Converting an entire folder
 * 
 * If you run the CLI on two folders, they are treated as a source and a
 * destination folder.  The CLI will convert all the files in the source folder
 * to HTML, and write the results to the destination folder using the same
 * filenames, but with each extension changed to `.html`.  The output form is
 * long-form HTML, meaning that it is ready to be opened in the main Lurch app.
 * 
 * `node cli.js path/to/your-source-folder path/to/your-destination-folder`
 * 
 * In this way, the user can write an entire library of mathematical documents
 * with dependencies among one another in a single folder, in a convenient
 * format like Markdown, and just occasionally compile them into the format used
 * in the main Lurch app, for distribution to users of that app.
 * 
 * This module is supported by {@link module:HeadlessLurch the headless Lurch
 * module}.
