# The Lurch user interface

This subfolder is for the web-based user interface for the Lurch app, which is
built primarily on the TinyMCE project, but includes many other components as
well.  For example, it includes code for loading files from (and sometimes also
saving files to) sources such as the web, the browser, your local computer, and
Dropbox.  It also includes extensions to TinyMCE to support mathematical
notation and environments, settings, documents with metadata and headings,
the ability to prepare HTML-based math content for processing by the validation
engine, and features for reporting the results that engine sends back.

Other folders in this repository include code for the core classes and for the
validation algorithm.

Not all code and comments in this repository are 100% up-to-date; some are in
the process of being updated as we clean up from a major reorganization of our
codebase.
