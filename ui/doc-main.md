## Lurch Web User Interface Source Code Documentation

This repository is just getting off the ground, but the goal is for it to be the
implementation of the latest design of the web-based user interface for the
software Lurch.

Since I'm just starting this repository, I will not add many details here yet,
but I will come back and add details later.
