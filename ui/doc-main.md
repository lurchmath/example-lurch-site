## Lurch Web User Interface Source Code Documentation

This API documentation covers the user interface for the current Lurch web app.
Use the navigation bar at the left to view the documetation for specific
classes.  Later, we will come back here and put some overview material about
the user interface, to help guide you through the navigation bar on the left,
but we have not yet done so.

[You can find the source code here.](https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch)
