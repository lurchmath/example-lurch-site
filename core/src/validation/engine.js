 * This module stores a collection of validation tools.  Each such tool is a

 *  * Argument 1 is a target {@link LogicConcept} to be validated.
 *  * Argument 2 is an options object, which this module guarantees will be the
 *    module-level validation options, possibly superceded by any options
 *    passed to the {@link module:Validation.validate validate function}, and
 *    further possibly overridden by options stored in the target itself.
 *  * The function should store the validation results in the target.  If you
 *    have a function that just returns validation results instead, you can
 *    easily convert it to one that writes its results into the target, using
 *    the convenient meta-function {@link module:Validation.functionToTool
 *    functionToTool()}.  If you are writing your own validation tool, you can
 *    write the results into a target using the
 *    {@link module:Validation.setResult setResult()} function.
 * 
 * Each tool gets stored under a name chosen by the client, so that the tool
 * can be referred to later by this name as a unique ID.  Installing another
 * tool later with the same name overwrites the previous.
 * 
 * If this is the first tool installed in this module, it will immediately
 * become the default.  You can change this later using the
 * {@link module:Validation.setOptions setOptions()} function; see its
 * documentation for further details.

 *  * `reason` - any string representing the reason for why the validation
