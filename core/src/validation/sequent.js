/**
 * In formal logic, a sequent, written using notation like
 * $P_1,\ldots,P_n\vdash C$, expresses the notion that the conclusion $C$
 * follows from the premises $P_1,\ldots,P_n$.  A sequent might be derivable or
 * not, and one can look for particular derivations that result in the sequent,
 * etc.
 * 
 * This class is a data structure for holding a sequent whose premises and
 * conclusion are all {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}.  It does not provide
 * any formal way to assess whether the sequent is valid; such tools are left
 * to other functionality in {@link module:Validation the Validation module}.
 * But it is useful to have this class because the construction of a sequent is
 * a rather technical thing to get right, and compartmentalizing all of those
 * technicalities into one file is good code organization.
 * 
 * Specifically, given a claim, one might try to form a sequent from it by just
 * computing its {@link MathConcept#accessibles list of accessibles}.  However,
 * there are several reasons why this does not always result in the correct set
 * of {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}.  None of these is deep or meaningful;
 * all are somewhat annoying technicalities whose handling we factor into the
 * tools in this class so that we might ignore it elsewhere.  All notation used
 * below is {@link MathConcept.fromPutdown putdown}.
 * 
 *  1. In a {@link BindingEnvironment}, say `(x y) , { A B }`, there is a body
 *     (the last child) and there are bound symbols (the children preceding the
 *     last).  In this case, the children of the {@link BindingEnvironment} are
 *     `x`, `y`, and `{ A B }`.  Thus if we considered what's accessible to
 *     `B`, we would find both `x` and `y`, even though neither is a
 *     proposition, nor is it "citable" at `B`.  Thus we would want to remove
 *     the bound variables of {@link BindingEnvironment}s from consideration
 *     when forming a sequent.
 *  2. Support for declared variables already exists in our class hierarchy,
 *     even though (at the time of this writing) it is not yet supported in our
 *     validation tools.  But when it is, we will want to reduce the contents
 *     of some premises to remove unusable children from them.  For example, if
 *     $E$ is an environment that begins with premise $P$ and later contains a
 *     claim $C$, we expect $E$ to mean at least `{ :P C }`.  However, if
 *     inside $E$ we declare $c$ to be a constant and thereafter prove several
 *     facts about $c$, including, say, $Q(c)$, then we would *not* expect the
 *     meaning of $E$ to include `{ :P Q(c) }`, because the scope of $c$ ends
 *     at the end of $E$.  So when adding $E$ to the premise list for a
 *     sequent, we will need to modify it to remove conclusions that cannot be
 *     safely "exported" from $E$.
 *  3. When we later add support for document dependencies, one possibility is
 *     to include dependencies as attributes of the document.  But that would
 *     put them nowhere in the document's parent/child hierarchy, and thus they
 *     would not ever show up as accessible to any {@link LogicConcept}.  Of
 *     course, they should be accessible to every {@link LogicConcept} in the
 *     document, so a sequent should know to add dependency content to its
 *     premise list.
 * 
 * As a consequence of all this, a sequent does not store the original
 * {@link LogicConcept} instances from the context in which it was created; it
 * must make copies so that it can modify them in (zero or more of) the ways
 * described above.
 * 
 * Furthemore, the original copies of the {@link LogicConcept} instances
 * accessible to a given conclusion may have extraneous attributes that are not
 * relevant to validation (and indeed might confound validation if they were
 * left in place).  Thus this class, when making copies of
 * {@link LogicConcept}s, also removes any unneeded attributes from them.  It
 * also ensures that all premises are marked as givens, and the conclusion is
 * not marked as a given, because a sequent has one item in positive position
 * (the conclusion) and $n-1$ items in negative position (the premises).
 * 
 * Again, all of these little details are technicalities that must be handled,
 * but that are not very conceptually interesting.  So we lump the handling of
 * them all into this one class.  The end result is stored as a single
 * {@link Environment} whose children are the contents of the sequent,
 * `{ :P_1 ... :P_n C }`, with the premises marked given and the conclusion not
 * marked given, with all of the above manipulations already applied.
