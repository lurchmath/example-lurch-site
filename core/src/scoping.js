/**
 * ## What is scoping?
 * 
 * The Lurch Deductive Engine supports the common notion of nested scopes for
 * symbols, a notion that appears in various ways in both mathematical language
 * and computer programming languages.
 * 
 *  * In mathematics, when we begin a proof by saying, "Let $x$ be an arbitrary
 *    real number," we do not expect that once the proof is over, we are still
 *    going to talk about $x$.  There is a notion of what computer scientists
 *    call "variable scope" that would say that the symbol $x$ is no longer
 *    accessible, or "in scope," after the proof has closed.
 *  * In almost all programming languages, this same principle appears.  For
 *    example, in JavaScript, the language in which the LDE is developed, one
 *    can write `function ( x ) { ... }` and the `x` is defined only within the
 *    curly brackets.  That is its "scope."
 * 
 * ## Scoping in Lurch
 * 
 * In Lurch, we use {@link Environment Environments} to delimit scope.  But how
 * do we know where a symbol's scope begins?  Notice in the two examples above
 * that explicit syntax marks the beginning of a variable's scope (in
 * mathematics, "Let...be arbitrary" and in JavaScript `function (...)`).  In
 * Lurch, we have three methods for marking the beginning of a variable's scope,
 * each of which could be used to represent mathematical content like the
 * example above.
 * 
 *  1. A {@link Declaration Declaration} of a symbol marks the beginning of a
 *     scope for that symbol, and includes the declaration's body (if it has
 *     one) and any other {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts} that follow the
 *     declaration in its parent environment.
 *      * We say that symbols declared in this way are *explicitly declared.*
 *      * You can find out which symbols a {@link Declaration Declaration}
 *        declares with its {@link Declaration#symbols symbols()} function.
 *  2. A {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironment} that binds a symbol $x$
 *     is itself the scope for $x$; that is, the scope lasts from the first
 *     through the last children of the environment, inclusive.
 *      * Symbols declared in this way are also said to be
 *        *explicitly declared.*
 *      * You can find out which symbols a {@link BindingEnvironment
 *        BindingEnvironment} declares with its
 *        {@link BindingInterface.boundSymbolNames boundSymbolNames()}
 *        function.
 *  3. A {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} functions just like a
 *     {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironment}, except within one single
 *     expression.  These are used for quantification, indexed operators,
 *     dummy variables in integration and $\lambda$ notation, and more.
 *      * Symbols introduced in this way are said to be *bound.*
 *      * You can find out which symbols a {@link BindingExpression
 *        BindingExpression} declares with its
 *        {@link BindingInterface.boundSymbolNames boundSymbolNames()}
 *        function.
 *  4. Any {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} can be marked as implicitly
 *     declaring a symbol.  If the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} so marked
 *     is an {@link Environment Environment}, then the implicit declaration
 *     functions just like case 2, above, and otherwise, it functions like case
 *     1.
 *      * Naturally, we say that a symbol declared in this way is
 *        *implicitly declared.*
 *      * You can add implicit declarations to any
 *        {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} with the
 *        {@link module:Scoping.addImplicitDeclaration addImplicitDeclaration()}
 *        function in this module, but you should do so only during the
 *        appropriate phase of scope checking.  Refer to the documentation of
 *        {@link module:Scoping.validate validate()} for details.
 *      * You can find out which symbols a {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept}
 *        implicitly declares with this module's
 *        {@link module:Scoping.implicitDeclarations implicitDeclarations()}
 *        function.
 * 
 * The fourth case may seem redundant, since it just repeats the functionality
 * of the earlier cases, but we will use that case to represent in a natural
 * way those mathematical situations in which it is typical to begin using
 * symbols without declaring them, such as in an algebra exercise (where
 * almost nobody says "let $x$ be arbitrary" before they solve for $x$), or a
 * derivation in propositional logic (where almost nobody says "let $P$ and
 * $Q$ be arbitrary propositions" before they write a propositional proof).
 * There are many other cases where symbols are used without being introduced,
 * but these are just two common examples.
 * 
 * ## Tools in this module
 * 
 * This module provides two types of functionality.  First, while scoping
 * information (including implicit symbol declarations and scoping error
 * feedback) is stored in the attributes of {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts},
 * and thus there is really no strict need for an API to manipulate such data,
 * an API makes it easier, more readable, and less error-prone.  So we provide
 * the following functions to that end.
 * 
 *  * For manipulating implicit symbol declaration data:
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.implicitDeclarations implicitDeclarations()}
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.addImplicitDeclaration addImplicitDeclaration()}
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.removeImplicitDeclaration removeImplicitDeclaration()}
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.clearImplicitDeclarations clearImplicitDeclarations()}
 *  * For manipulating feedback about scoping errors:
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.scopeErrors scopeErrors()}
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.addScopeError addScopeError()}
 *     * {@link module:Scoping.clearScopeErrors clearScopeErrors()}
 * 
 * Second, the main workhorse function of this module is to run a scope checking
 * algorithm on any given {@link Environment Environment}.  That function is
 * called {@link module:Scoping.validate validate()}, and you can read its
 * documentation for greater details.
 * 
 * Note also that this module sort of shares a name with the function
 * {@link MathConcept#scope scope()} (and its related functions) because for any
 * {@link Declaration Declaration} D, the scope of the symbols introduced in
 * that declaration is precisely `D.scope()`, as defined in
 * {@link MathConcept#scope the documentation of the scope() function}.

/**
 * Refer to the documentation at the top of this page for information on what
 * scoping is in general.  This function is the main workhorse that validates
 * symbol scoping inside an arbitrary {@link Environment Environment}.  It will
 * typically be called on the topmost environment provided as input to Lurch, so
 * that all symbols in the entire input have been analyzed for where their
 * scopes begin and end.
 * 
 * This function can be called in two ways.  First, it can be called with just
 * one argument, in which case only the following tasks are done:
 * 
 *  * Any symbol declaration (by a {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironment}
 *    or a {@link Declaration Declaration}) that declares a symbol $x$ while
 *    sitting in the scope of some other declaration of the same symbol $x$ is
 *    {@link module:Scoping.scopeErrors marked with a scoping error} of the
 *    form `{ redeclared : [ 'x' ] }`.  If more than one symbol is redeclared,
 *    the array may contain multiple entries.
 *  * Any symbol $x$ bound by a {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} in
 *    the scope of a declaration of the same symbol $x$ or another binding of
 *    the same symbol $x$ is {@link module:Scoping.scopeErrors marked with a
 *    scoping error} of the form `{ redeclared : [ 'x' ] }`.  If more than one
 *    symbol is redeclared by the binding, the array may contain multiple
 *    entries.
 *  * Any symbol $x$ used {@link MathConcept#isFree free} in an
 *    {@link Expression Expression} but not in the scope of any declaration (by
 *    a {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironment} or a
 *    {@link Declaration Declaration}) is
 *    {@link module:Scoping.scopeErrors marked with a scoping error} of the form
 *    `{ undeclared : [ 'x' ] }`.  If more than one symbol is used
 *    {@link MathConcept#isFree free} and undeclared, the array may contain
 *    multiple entries.  Such an error is placed only on the first use of the
 *    symbol in any given scope; later uses of the same symbol in the same scope
 *    are not also marked.
 * 
 * Note that a single {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} might have more than one
 * type of error.  For instance, a {@link Declaration Declaration} that attempts
 * to re-declare a symbol $x$, and whose body contains the symbols $y$ and $z$
 * free and undeclared might have an error of the form
 * `{ redeclared : [ 'x' ], undeclared : [ 'y', 'z' ] }`.
 * 
 * There are a variety of sensible ways to handle variables that are free and
 * undeclared.  On the permissive end of the spectrum, a client may wish to
 * simply ignore them, in which case the error feedback under the `undeclared`
 * headings can be ignored.  On the strict end of the spectrum, a client may
 * refuse to process input that contains free and undeclared symbols.  Such
 * clients can pay particular attention to the feedback under the `undeclared`
 * headings.  But many clients will take a middle road of some type, such as
 * treating the first use of the symbol as an implicit declaration of the
 * symbol, either at that location, or at the beginning of its parent
 * environment, or something else.
 * 
 * To help clients who wish to take this middle road, this function has an
 * optional second argument.  If a function is provided as the second argument,
 * it will be called on the first instance of every free and undeclared symbol
 * *before* the validation work described above is executed.  The function will
 * be passed two parameters at each call: the name of the symbol that appears
 * free and undeclared, and the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} in which it
 * appears.  These calls will take place in tree-traversal order (that is,
 * {@link MathConcept#isEarlierThan earlier nodes} first).
 * 
 * The callback function will often want to mark some
 * {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} as the location of the implicit declaration
 * of the symbol in question.  It can do so by calling
 * {@link module:Scoping.addImplicitDeclaration addImplicitDeclaration()}.  Note
 * that an implicit declaration marked in a {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} L
 * takes effect exactly at L, in the sense that the scope of the declaration
 * includes L itself and continues on through the rest of L's scope.
 * 
 * While callers can provide a callback function for whatever behavior they
 * desire, we also provide some pre-built callback functions, for common actions
 * the caller may desire:
 * {@link module:Scoping.declareWhenSeen declareWhenSeen()},
 * {@link module:Scoping.declareInAncestor declareInAncestor()},
 * {@link module:Scoping.declareGlobal declareGlobal()}, and
 * {@link module:Scoping.doNotDeclare doNotDeclare()}.

 * @param {LogicConcept} target the LogicConcept in which to do the work

 * {@link Environment Environment} in which the symbol was used free and
 * undeclared.  This behavior is complex enough that it bears illustrating
 * with a few examples.
 * 
 * **Example 1:** If the symbol appears free and undeclared in only one
 * expression, then that expression's parent environment is the one in which
 * it will be marked implicitly declared.
 * 
 * **Example 2:** If the symbol appears free and undeclared in an expression,
 * and then also in another expression that sits in an enclosing environment
 * (an ancestor a few levels above the target), then it will be marked
 * implicitly declared in that outer, ancestor environment, and not anywhere
 * else.  Because the implicit declaration acts as a declaration at the start
 * of the enclosing ancestor, its scope includes all the descendants,
 * including both expressions in which it appears free and undeclared.
 * 
 * **Example 3:** If the symbol appears free and undeclared twice, once in an
 * expression in an environment $E_1$ and the other time in an expression in
 * an environment $E_2$, and both $E_1$ and $E_2$ are children of the same
 * parent, then implicit declarations will be added to both $E_1$ and $E_2$,
 * because they are each the smallest enclosing environment for the free and
 * undeclared instance of the symbol within them.
