// List the pattern-then-expressions tuples in this multi-matching problem:
// (Note that once one is marked "optional," all later ones are optional also.)

// List all solutions in this optional multi-matching problem:
// (Note that each one comes with a list of indices,
// followed by a metavariable assignment.  Negative indices indicate that the
// pattern in question was optional and was not matched to any expression.)
