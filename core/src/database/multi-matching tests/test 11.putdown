testing:
  type: possible sufficient instantiations

// Metavariables used in the formula below:
(metavariables A B)

// The formula to be instantiated:
{
    :A
    :B
    (^ A B)
}
// Note that the above formula will become the following sequence of patterns:
// [ A, B, (^ A B) ]

// The sequent we will attempt to make true:
{
    :X
    :(-> Y Z)
    :Y
    (^ Y X)
}
// Note that the above formula will become the following sequence of patterns:
// [ X, (-> Y Z), Y, (^ Y X) ]

// The options to use when searching:
(options intuitionistic) // but still keep the default of not direct

// List all solutions expected:
// (Note that each one comes with a list of indices, followed by a metavariable
// assignment.  Negative indices indicate that the pattern in question was
// optional and was not matched to any expression.)
(solutions
    ( 2  0  3)  (A Y   B X)  // in this case, must instantiate all three
