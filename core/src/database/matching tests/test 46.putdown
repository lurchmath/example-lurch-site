// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(Subproof x , (@apply P x))  (Subproof T , (R T T))
	(forall y , (@apply P y))    (forall T , (R T T))
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		P  (@lambda v , (R v v))
	)
)
