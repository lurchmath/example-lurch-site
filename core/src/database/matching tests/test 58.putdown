// This file was autogenerated as part of an export process from an old repository.

// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P t)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(@apply P t)               (eq (choose 6 3) 20)
	(exists x , (@apply P x))  (exists n , (eq (choose 6 n) 20))
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		P  (@lambda v , (eq (choose 6 v) 20))
		t  3
	)
)
