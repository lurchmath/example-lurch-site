// This file was autogenerated as part of an export process from an old repository.

// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P T)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(forall x , (@apply P x))  (forall r , (gt (plus (sq r) 1) 0))
	(@apply P T)               (gt (plus (sq -9) 1) 0)
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		T  -9
		P  (@lambda v , (gt (plus (sq v) 1) 0))
	)
)
