// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables a b P)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(eq a b)      (eq 1 2)
	(@apply P a)  (eq (plus 1 1) 2)
	(@apply P b)  (eq (plus 2 2) 2)
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		a  1
		b  2
		P  (@lambda v , (eq (plus v v) 2))
	)
)
