/**
 * This file recursively finds and reads all .putdown and .smackdown files in
 * all subfolders of the src/database folder and stores them in one large JSON
 * object.  It then creates a JavaScript file that includes that full JSON
 * object as a * module-level constant, as well as several utility functions
 * for querying its contents.  Those functions appear (and are documented) in
 * footer.js.
 * 
 * Unlike most JavaScript files in this repository, this one is not intended
 * for use in the browser, but is a script to be run by Node.js.  To run it,
 * call "npm run build-db" from the repository root.  It generates the source
 * file src/database.js.
 * 
 * Each .putdown and .smackdown file must contain either exclusivly putdown
 * content (that is amenable to parsing by LogicConcept.fromPutdown(text)) or
 * smackdown content, respectively, or such content preceded by a YAML header,
 * as in the following example.
 * 
 * ---
 * language: yaml
 * example: true
 * ---
 * 
 * Such headers can be used to include other putdown files at the top of a
 * putdown file that contains the header, in the order specified, or include
 * either putdown or smackdown files at the top of the smackdown file
 * containing the header.  (But you cannot include smackdown files into putdown
 * files, since smackdown is a strict superset of putdown.)  They can use
 * relative paths (which are relative to the putdown file in question) or
 * absolute paths (which are resolved from the src/database/ folder).  Here is
 * an example.
 * 
 * ---
 * includes:
 *  - some/relative/path/file.putdown
 *  - /some/absolute/path/other.putdown
 * ---
 * 
 * Any other metadata can be stored in the YAML header and will be converted
 * to a JSON object when the file is read into the database.
