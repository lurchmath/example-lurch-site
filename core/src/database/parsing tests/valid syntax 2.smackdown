// This file contains more complex smackdown, including labels,
// references, and proof markers.

\begin{proof}
    // Let x be arbitrary and mark it with label "1"
    [x]        \label{1}
    // Assume x is a real number and mark it with label "2"
    :$x∈R$     \label{2}
    // Claim that x is a complex number, by Theorem 21
    $x∈C$      \reason{Theorem 21}
    // (Even though no reason command has a built-in meaning implemented,
    // smackdown will still parse it and remember it was a command.)
\end{proof}
