/**
 * In many situations, it's useful to be able to create new symbols, which
 * means symbols that have not already appeared in a given context.  Consider
 * the following example.
 * 
 * Say we have a mathematical expression like $\forall x,x>y$, and we wish to
 * substitute some value for $y$, and we want to avoid variable capture.
 * That is, perhaps we're substituting $y=x^2$, and we want to avoid the $x$ in
 * $x^2$ becoming bound by the quantifier.  So we need to perform
 * $\alpha$-renaming on $\forall x,x>y$, using a new symbol that does not
 * show up in any of these expressions so far.  That is, the new symbol should
 * not be any of $x,y,\forall,>,=,2$.
 * 
 * In that example, we would like to create one new symbol, where "new" means
 * "does not appear in any of a chosen set of expressions."  In other
 * situations, we may need to create many new variables, such as when
 * constructing an $n$-ary $\lambda$ expression and needing to name its
 * parameters.  In either case, a NewSymbolStream can solve the problem, as
 * follows.
 * 
 * {@link NewSymbolStream Construct a NewSymbolStream}, passing as arguments to
 * the constructor all the expressions containing "old" symbols, those that are
 * not permitted to be created.  Then ask for one new symbol with
 * {@link NewSymbolStream#next next()}, or ask for many new symbols with
 * {@link NewSymbolStream#nextN nextN()}.
