/**
 * {@link Problem Matching problems} are of the form
 * $\\{(p_1,e_1),\ldots,(p_n,e_n)\\}$, where each $p_i$ is pattern and each
 * $e_i$ is an expression.  A {@link Solution Solution} $S$ to such a problem
 * is such that for every $i\in\\{1,\ldots,n\\}$, $S(p_i)=e_i$.  You can
 * compute the full set of such solutions with {@link Problem#solutions the
 * solutions() member}.  More details are given in the documentation for
 * {@link module:Matching the Matching module}.
 * 
 * This function generalizes that capability as follows.
 * 
 * It supports problems of the form $\\{(p_1,E_1),\ldots,(p_n,E_n)\\}$, where
 * the $p_i$ are as before but the $E_i$ are sets of expressions.  It yields
 * all solutions $S$ satisfying $S(p_i)\in E_i$.  (The special case where each
 * $E_i$ has exactly one entry is the original notion of a matching problem as
 * stated above.)  This algorithm is designed to explore the wider space of
 * possible solutions created by permitting larger $E_i$, but in the most
 * efficient way, organizing the exploration to prune the largest branches in
 * the search tree as early as possible.
 * 
 * In addition to producing solutions $S$ satisfying $S(p_i)\in E_i$, because
 * each $E_i$ is not just a set but an array, each $S$ can come with a mapping
 * $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ that tells us exactly which entry of each $E_i$
 * was matched: not only is $S(p_i)\in E_i$ but $S(p_i)=E_i[f(i)]$, that is,
 * the $f(i)$th entry in the list $E_i$.  This mapping is returned for each
 * solution $S$ generated, and in the parameters below is named the
 * "expressionIndices" list for that solution.  Specifically, we encode such an
 * $f$ as a simple JavaScript array $[f(1),\ldots,f(n)]$.  Each such
 * expressionIndices array has length $n$, where $n$ comes from the original
 * input to this function.
 * 
 * @param {LogicConcept[]} patterns JavaScript array of LogicConcept instances,
 *   each of which may contain {@link module:Matching.metavariable
 *   metavariables}, and each will be used as a pattern.  The elements
 *   `patterns[i]` in this array are the patterns documented as $p_i$ above.
 * @param {LogicConcept[][]} expressionLists array of arrays of LogicConcept
 *   instances, none of which should contain metavariables; the outer array
 *   must be the same length as `patterns`, because each array within it
 *   corresponds to an entry in `patterns`, as discussed above.  That is, the
 *   elements `expressionLists[i]` in this array are the "sets" documented as
 *   $E_i$ above.
 * @param {Solution} [soFar] used in recursion, defaults to an empty Solution;
 *   clients typically do not provide this value
 * @param {boolean} [debug] whether to print debugging information to the
 *   console while it does its job, defaults to false
 * @returns {Object[]} an array of objects, each of which has two entries:
 *   one under the key "solution" maps to a solution as described above, and
 *   the entry under the key "expressionIndices" is an array of integers that
 *   indicates which entry in each of the `expressionLists` is matched by each
 *   of the `patterns`

/**
 * There will be situations in which we want to seek instantiations of patterns
 * but not require absolutely every pattern to be instantiated.
 * 
 * The simplest example is probably the following:  Imagine we have a formula
 * for the introduction of a conditional, such as `:{ :{ :A B } (=> A B) }` if
 * we're using {@link LogicConcept.fromPutdown putdown notation}.  We're
 * checking to see if it justifies conclusion `(=> P Q)`, so we need to find a
 * premise of the form `{ :P Q }`.  But actually, we would accept a premise
 * that's just of the form `Q` even if there is no `P` in sight, because that
 * could be strictly stronger than `{ :P Q }`, so we would want to run it
 * through validation to see if it works.  Thus we do not need to match both
 * `P` and `Q` when searching; we must match `Q` and can optionally also match
 * `P`.
 * 
 * That's not an excellent example, because of course just matching the final
 * conclusion `(=> A B)` to `(=> P Q)` provides us with the full instantiation,
 * but there are many example of rules with environment premises, and not all
 * are so simple.
 * 
 * We therefore create this function, which behaves exactly like
 * {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}, except that
 * you can provide an index that indicates how to separate the constraints into
 * the required ones and the optional ones.  We call that index
 * `firstOptional`, and it has the meaning that it is the index of the first
 * optional constraint, in the sense that all previous ones are required, and
 * any constraint from that point onward is optional.
 * 
 * The return values will be exactly like those for
 * {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}, except that
 * some of the expression indices may be $-1$, indicating that the pattern was
 * not matched to any expression.  Only optional constraints will have an
 * expression index of $-1$; all required constraints will have non-negative
 * expression indices.
 * 
 * @param {LogicConcept[]} patterns this parameter has the same meaning as it
 *   has in {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}; see
 *   the documentation there
 * @param {LogicConcept[][]} expressionLists this parameter has the same
 *   meaning as it has in {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations
 *   allInstantiations()}; see the documentation there
 * @param {integer} firstOptional the index of the first optional constraint.
 *   To indicate that all constraints are required, set this value to be less
 *   than 0 or larger than the last valid index into `patterns`.
 * @param {Solution} soFar this parameter has the same meaning as it has in
 *   {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}; see the
 *   documentation there
 * @param {boolean} debug this parameter has the same meaning as it has in
 *   {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}; see the
 *   documentation there
 * @returns {Object[]} the return value has the same format as it has in
 *   {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations allInstantiations()}; see the
 *   documentation there, plus the comments above about $-1$ expression indices
 *   for unmatched and optional constraints
