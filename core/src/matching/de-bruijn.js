/**
 * ## What are de Bruijn indices?
 * 
 * One way to express bound variables without giving them explicit names is to
 * use *de Bruijn indices,* a technique that replaces symbols with numbers.  The
 * standard version of this method applies to the $\lambda$-calculus, replacing
 * a bound variable $x$ with a natural number $n$ that is equal to the number of
 * levels of nested $\lambda$ expressions one must walk up the syntax tree to
 * find the one that binds $x$.
 * 
 * For example, $\lambda f.\lambda g.(f~(g~x))$ could be expressed as
 * $\lambda.\lambda.(2~(1~x))$.  Notice these properties of the example:
 * 
 *  1. The inner $f$ of the original expression is replaced with a 2, because
 *     one must walk out two "$\lambda$ levels" to find the $\lambda$ that
 *     originally bound $f$.
 *  1. The inner $g$ is now a 1 because it was bound by the first $\lambda$
 *     above it.
 *  1. The bound variable names are not needed, because the order of
 *     quantification is clear from the indices.
 * 
 * Had the example been something like $(\circ~(\lambda~x.x)~(\lambda~y.y))$,
 * it would have become $(\circ~(\lambda.1)~(\lambda.1))$, showcasing how de
 * Bruijn indices reduce $\alpha$-equivalence to mere expression equality.
 * 
 * ## Purpose of this module
 * 
 * This module provides tools to encode {@link MathConcept} instances using de
 * Bruijn indices, but we make the following changes to extend the method from
 * the standard version introduced above to a version that supports the full
 * range of {@link MathConcept MathConcepts}.
 * 
 *  1. It is not only $\lambda$ expressions that are supported, but any kind of
 *     {@link BindingExpression}.  For example, we can encode $\forall~x.(P~x)$
 *     as $\forall.(P~1)$.
 *  2. Because a {@link BindingExpression} can bind multiple variables, we must
 *     distinguish them, so our indices will be pairs, one index for the binding
 *     level (as above) and one index for which position within that binding was
 *     occupied by the symbol being encoded.  For example, $\forall x,y.(>~x~y)$
 *     can be encoded as $\forall.(>~(1,1)~(1,2))$, where I'm using the
 *     standard notation for pairs.  This applies even if the binder binds only
 *     one variable, so the example from item 1., above, would actually be
 *     encoded as $\forall.(P~(1,1))$.
 *  3. Unlike the original de Bruijn notation, we will use zero-based indexing,
 *     to be consistent with everything else in our codebase, which uses
 *     zero-based indexing.  Thus the two examples from item 2., above, would
 *     actually be encoded as $\forall.(>~(0,0)~(0,1))$ and $\forall.(P~(0,0))$,
 *     respectively.
 * 
 * The notation used above is to illustrate the general concept of the de Bruijn
 * conversion only.  Obviously pairs like $(a,b)$ and bindings with no bound
 * symbols like $\lambda.1$ are not valid {@link LogicConcept#fromPutdown
 * putdown notation}, so they do not represent the actual encoding.  The details
 * of that encoding appear in the next section.
 * 
 * ## Functions in this module
 * 
 * Given a {@link Symbol}, we can compute its encoding as a pair of de Bruijn
 * indices with {@link module:deBruijn.encodeSymbol encodeSymbol()}.  We
 * represent that pair as another {@link Symbol} whose name is a JSON encoding
 * that includes the pair of indices, and that has the original symbol name
 * stored as an attribute, so that the conversion can
 * be inverted later (with {@link module:deBruijn.decodeSymbol decodeSymbol()}).
 * However, if you wish to fetch just the indices of the encoded symbol, you can
 * do so with {@link module:deBruijn.encodedIndices encodedIndices()}.
 * 
 * The {@link module:deBruijn.encodeSymbol encodeSymbol()} function is not,
 * however, of much use to clients, who typically want to encode entire
 * {@link Expression Expressions}, not just individual symbols within them.
 * Given an {@link Expression}, we can compute its de Bruijn encoding using
 * {@link module:deBruijn.encodeExpression encodeExpression()}.  It yields
 * another expression with the following properties.
 * 
 *  * At each position where a {@link Symbol} had sat, its encoding (under
 *    {@link module:deBruijn.encodeSymbol encodeSymbol()}) will sit instead.
 *  * The entire resulting expression contains no
 *    {@link BindingExpression BindingExpressions}.
 *  * At each position where a {@link BindingExpression} had sat as a
 *    subexpression, instead an {@link Application} now sits, of the form
 *    `(A B)`, where `A` is a special symbol indicating that a
 *    {@link BindingExpression} has been encoded, and `B` is the encoding of the
 *    body of the original {@link BindingExpression}.
 *  * Each such `A` will be decorated with an attribute that records the
 *    original names of the bound symbols, so that this encoding is invertible
 *    (using {@link module:deBruijn.decodeExpression decodeExpression()}).
 * 
 * To give one full, explicit example, consider the {@link Expression} (in
 * {@link LogicConcept#fromPutdown putdown notation})
 * `(forall (x y) , (> x y))`.  Its de Bruijn encoding, according to this
 * module, would be the following.  I will use the symbol `"LDE DB"` as the
 * special symbol meaning "encoded binding" and also as the attribute key for
 * all de Bruijn attributes.  Some JSON encodings have been simplified for
 * readability, as you can see below.
 * 
 * ```
 * (forall
 *   ("LDE DB" +{"LDE DB":"['x','y']"} // list of bound variable names
 *     (>
 *       "['LDE DB',0,0]" +{"LDE DB":"JSON encoding of original x symbol"}
 *       "['LDE DB',0,1]" +{"LDE DB":"JSON encoding of original y symbol"}
 *     )
 *   )
 * )
 * ```
 * 
 * The module also provides a {@link module:deBruijn.free freeness test} for de
 * Bruijn indices, which returns true for an index $(n,m)$ iff there are at
 * least $n+1$ encoded bindings surrounding the symbol.
 * 
 * ## Coordinating with matching
 * 
 * There are two exceptions to the above encoding description, each of which
 * helps this module integrate correctly with the larger module in which it
 * sits, {@link module:Matching the Matching module}.
 * 
 * First, when encoding a symbol, if the symbol is a metavariable, then don't
 * encode it at all, but leave it in its original form.
 * 
 * Second, one of the special symbols in the matching package, the one that
 * marks Expression Functions Applications, is not encoded, but is left
 * unchanged under the de Bruijn encoding.  That way, Expression Function
 * Applications retain their meanings under the de Bruijn encoding.
 * 
 * Finally, we do not need to apply the same protection to the Expression
 * Function symbol, because we will not be applying the de Bruijn encoding to
 * Expression Functions, and it would break them anyway, since it removes all
 * bindings.  But when decoding the image of a metavariable in a solution, an
 * Expression Function may be present, so the
 * {@link module:deBruijn.decodeExpression decodeExpression()} function recurs
 * inside such structures.
 * 
 * ## Expression equality
 * 
 * As mentioned above, one of the benefits of de Bruijn indices is that two
 * expressions are $\alpha$-equivalent iff their de Bruijn encodings are exactly
 * equal.  However, the implementation above mentions that our encoding function
 * stores the original names of the bound symbols as attributes so that the
 * encoding is invertible.  Thus if we encode the identity function
 * $\lambda x.x$ and also encode the identity function $\lambda y.y$, although
 * the resulting expressions would seem equal, both being something like
 * $\lambda.(0,0)$, but their attributes would distinguish them:
 * 
 * ```
 * // Encoding of (lambda x , x):
 * (lambda
 *   ("LDE DB" +{"LDE DB":['x']}
 *     "['LDE DB',0,0]" +{"LDE DB":"JSON encoding of the symbol x"}
 *   )
 * )
 * // Encoding of (lambda y , y):
 * (lambda
 *   ("LDE DB" +{"LDE DB":['y']}
 *     "['LDE DB',0,0]" +{"LDE DB":"JSON encoding of the symbol y"}
 *   )
 * )
 * ```
 * 
 * Without the attributes, we would be comparing
 * `(lambda ("LDE DB" "['LDE DB',0,0]"))` to itself.  With the attributes, we
 * can still distinguish formerly-$x$ from formerly-$y$, which is undesirable.
 * 
 * Thus we need a way to compare two expressions for equality, but ignore these
 * hidden attributes that are present only to enable the inversion of the de
 * Bruijn encoding.  We define the {@link module:deBruijn.equal equal()}
 * function for this purpose.  It simply calls the {@link MathConcept#equals
 * equals()} function in the {@link MathConcept} class, passing an optional
 * argument that tells it to ignore the attributes in question when doing its
 * comparison.
