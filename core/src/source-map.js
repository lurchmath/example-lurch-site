/**
 * A source map is an object that tracks a specific type of correspondence
 * between two strings, reminiscent of the source maps used when compiling
 * or minifying JavaScript code for use in web browsers.  The first string,
 * called the {@link SourceMap#source source text}, is the original text
 * (which can be computer code or any other text), and remains unchanged
 * throughout the life of the source map object.  The second string, called
 * the {@link SourceMap#modified modified text} begins life equal to the
 * source text, but can be changed thereafter with
 * {@link SourceMap#modify modifications/replacements}.
 * 
 * The purpose of the source map is to keep track of which sequences of
 * characters in the source text correspond to which sequences of characters
 * in the modified text, so that any position in one string can be converted
 * to the corresponding position in the other string.
 * 
 * In a simple example, let's say we have the source text "I wonder what 5+9
 * equals."  Then we run on that text an algorithm that finds all occurrences
 * of simple arithmetic expressions and computes them, replacing the original
 * expression with its result, in this case producing "I wonder what 14
 * equals."  The source map would represent the following facts:
 * 
 *  * Characters 0 through 13 in the source text correspond to characters 0
 *    through 13 in the modified text.  (They are "I wonder what " in both
 *    cases.)
 *  * Characters 14 through 16 in the source text ("5+9") correspond to
 *    characters 14 through 15 in the modified text ("14").
 *  * Characters 17 through 24 in the source text correspond to characters 16
 *    through 23 in the modified text.  (They are " equals." in both cases.)
 * 
 * In general, a source map will always be an array of such correspondences,
 * each of which is a quadruple of integer indices, two into the source text
 * and two into the modified text.  Such data would be stored internally as
 * that array of quadruples,
 * 
 * ```json
 * [
 *     [  0, 13,  0, 13 ],
 *     [ 14, 16, 14, 15 ],
 *     [ 17, 24, 16, 23 ]
 * ]
 * ```
 * 
 * Quadruples at even indices correspond to unmodified sequences of characters
 * while quadruples at odd indices correspond to modified sequences of
 * characters.  In the list above, entries 0 and 2 are for unmodified text and
 * entry 1 is the only modified text.
 * 
 * To use this class, the user creates an instance, passing the original
 * (unmodified) source text.  Then the user can do modifications (that is,
 * replacements) on the source text by calling {@link SourceMap#modify
 * modify()}, taking care to make such calls in increasing order of index into
 * the modified text.  (See documentation for {@link SourceMap#modify
 * modify()}, below.)  At any point, functions such as
 * {@link SourceMap#sourcePosition sourcePosition()},
 * {@link SourceMap#modifiedPosition modifiedPosition()},
 * {@link SourceMap#sourceLineAndColumn sourceLineAndColumn()}, and
 * {@link SourceMap#modifiedLineAndColumn modifiedLineAndColumn()} are
 * available to perform lookup in either direction (source to modified, or the
 * reverse).

     * Source map objects contain both a source text and a modified text,

     * this function, the modified text can change, diverging from the source
     * text.  This function not only makes such modifications, but it records
     * where they were made, and any data associated with them, so that
     * queries can be made later about correspondences between the source and
     * modified text, as documented at the top of this file.
     * 
     * The first three parameters are straightforward, as documented below.
     * However, the fourth parameter (which is optional) requires additional
     * explanation.  When replacing a portion of the source text, it is
     * sometimes convenient to replace it not with text, but with arbitrary
     * data.  We support this more advanced usage as follows.
     * 
     *  * First, the newly inserted text cannot be arbitrary text, but should
     *    instead be a special marker that indicates the location where
     *    non-text data resides.  To create such markers, use the
     *    {@link SourceMap#nextMarker nextMarker()} function.
     *  * Second, the fourth parameter (`data`) should be provided, and it can
     *    be any JavaScript object amenable to JSON encoding, which will be
     *    stored in this object for later querying.
     *  * Later, when the client processes the modified text, upon
     *    encountering a marker (see {@link SourceMap.isMarker isMarker()})
     *    and desiring to know what data it represents, the client can find
     *    out with a call to {@link SourceMap#dataForMarker dataForMarker()}.
     * 
     * For example, let's say our source text was "Get me employee #16" and
     * we wanted to replace "employee #16" with the full data for that
     * employee, which is not text data, but rather something more complex,
     * such as `{ name:'Henrietta', age:35, ... }`.  Assuming we have that
     * data in an object `obj`, we could make a call like the following.
     * 
     * ```js
     * sourcemap.modify( 7, 12, sourcemap.nextMarker(), obj )
     * ```
     * 
     * Notes:
     * 
     *  1. When passing data as the optional fourth parameter, you must pass
     *     `sourcemap.nextMarker()` as the third parameter, because data is
     *     stored internally only associated with markers, and cannot be
     *     retrieved later otherwise.
     *  2. The starting index documented below is in the modified text, not
     *     the source text, but if this is inconvenient for you, simply make
     *     use of the {@link SourceMap#modifiedPosition modifiedPosition()}
     *     function to convert what you have to what you need.
     *  3. Modifications must be made in increasing order of index in the
     *     modified text.  For example, if you have a replacement to do on
     *     characters 5 through 10 and another to do on characters 50 through
     *     70, you must do them in that order, not the reverse.  This class
     *     does not support modifications in arbitrary order.
     * 
     * @param {integer} start the starting index, in the modified text, where
     *   this next modification should be recorded
     * @param {integer} length the length of the text to be replaced, starting
     *   at the index `start`
     * @param {string} replacement the text with which to replace the chosen
     *   portion of the source text
     * @param [Object] data arbitrary JSON data to store in the modified
     *   text, as documented above
