/**
 * Many mathematical expressions include "dummy variables," also called "bound
 * variables."  For example, $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ uses $i$ as a "dummy" or "bound"
 * variable.  Similarly, $\int x^2\;dx$ has $x$ as a bound varibale.  There are
 * many other examples, including (but not limited to) the following.
 * 
 *  * indexed sums, products, unions, and intersections throughout mathematics
 *  * set-builder notation, e.g., $\left\\{ x+y \mid 0 < x < y \right\\}$
 *  * existentially and universally quantified expressions, such as
 *    $\forall x > 0, ~|x|=x$.
 *  * $\lambda$ expressions from computer science, as in $\lambda x.x$
 * 
 * We say that such expressions "bind" the dummy/bound variable, and we have two
 * types of them in Lurch: {@link BindingExpression BindingExpressions} and
 * {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironments}.  In order to factor the
 * common attributes out of those two classes, we implement the notion of
 * binding as what some languages call an "interface," here.  We place it in the
 * {@link BindingInterface BindingInterface} namespace, and it can be added to
 * any class by calling the {@link BindingInterface.addTo addTo()} function.
 * 
 * Each of the example types of expressions given above include not only a body
 * in which a variable is bound, but also an operator applied to that body.  For
 * example, in $\bigcup_i A_i$, we not only have the body $A_i$ in which $i$ is
 * bound, but we are also applying the union operator to that body.  However, we
 * do not include the operator in the binding itself, because not all cases use
 * an operator; in particular, {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironments} do
 * not have an operator.
 * 
 * Consequently, when encoding something like $\bigcup_i A_i$, we would encode
 * the $A_i$ as the body of a {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} with a
 * bound variable list of length 1, containing just $i$, and then wrap that
 * {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} in an
 * {@link Application Application} of the $\cup$ {@link Symbol Symbol}.  One
 * might construct it with code like the following example (though this is not
 * the only possible way to encode such an idea).
 * 
 * ```js
 * new Application(
 *     new LurchSymbol( 'â‹ƒ' ),
 *     new BindingExpression(
 *         new LurchSymbol( 'i' ),
 *         new Application(
 *             new LurchSymbol( 'subscript' ),
 *             new LurchSymbol( 'A' ),
 *             new LurchSymbol( 'i' )
 *         )
 *     )
 * )
 * ```
 * 
 * Bindings were inspired by a structure of the same name defined in
 * {@link https://openmath.org/about/ the OpenMath Standard}, but the reader
 * is not expected to read that standard; we define in this documentation our
 * version of what a binding is, both for {@link Expression Expressions} and
 * {@link Environment Environments}.
 * 
 * A binding is defined by a sequence of $n$ children satisfying the following
 * requirements.  Most functions in this interface depend upon these
 * requirements being satisfied in order for the functions to work correctly.
 * Constructors for classes implementing this interface should check to ensure
 * that these requirements are satisfied at construction time, and provide
 * documentation stating that clients should not violate these requirements with
 * tree manipulation later.
 * 
 *  * The first $n-1$ children will be the sequence of bound variables.  There
 *    must be at least one bound variable, so we have that $n>1$.  Each bound
 *    variable must be a {@link Symbol Symbol}.  You can use
 *    {@link BindingInterface.allAreSymbols allAreSymbols()} to help verify the
 *    requirement.
 *  * The last child is called the {@link BindingInterface.body body()}.  This
 *    is what "sits inside" the binding, such as the integrand in an integral,
 *    the summand in a summation, the inner statement in a quantification, etc.
 *    Although it is most commonly an {@link Expression Expression}, it does not
 *    have to be; a binding with an {@link Expression Expression} body is a
 *    {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} and a binding with an
 *    {@link Environment Environment} body is a
 *    {@link BindingEnvironment BindingEnvironment}.  Binding environments are
 *    typically subproofs that begin with the declaration of one or more
 *    arbitrary variables, which act as bound within that subproof.
 * 
 * The API provided in this namespace can be added to any class by calling the
 * {@link BindingInterface.addTo addTo()} function on the class's prototype.
 * Then all the functions documented below will be available in members of that
 * class.
 *
