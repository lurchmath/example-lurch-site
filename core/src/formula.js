 * `{ :(= a b) (= b a) }` and we assume it is in the scope of a
 * {@link Declaration} of the `=` {@link Symbol}, but not of the `a` or `b`
 * {@link Symbol Symbols}, then converting `{ :(= a b) (= b a) }` to a formula
 * would produce a copy in which each instance of `a` and `b` have had their
 * metavariable attribute set to "true" (via a call to the
 * {@link MathConcept#makeIntoA makeIntoA()} member).
 * 
 * The exception is that bound variables are never marked as metavariables.
 * 
 * @param {LogicConcept} LC - the {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} to convert

 * @param {boolean} [inPlace] - if `true`, the metavariables will be attributed in
 * `LC` itself, and the resulting modified `LC` is returned.  If `false`, it will
 * attribute and return a separate copy of `LC`, leaving the original unchanged.

/**
 * The concept of variable capture in a quantifier (or, more generically, in a
 * {@link BindingExpression}) is a well-known one, and is also documented
 * in functions such as {@link MathConcept#isFree this one}.  But
 * {@link Declaration Declarations} function similarly to bindings, except their
 * scope spans multiple expressions in the same (or inner) environments.  So we
 * can consider a secondary type of symbol capture, one in which we substitute
 * into an expression $E$ in the scope of a declaration $D$, and doing so
 * inserts an instance of a symbol $s$ that is free in $E$ but is declared by
 * $D$.  This function checks to see whether that would happen if we applied an
 * instantiation to a formula.
 * 
 * For example, if we create a formula from the putdown notation
 * `{ :[x] (+ a 1) }`, with both `x` and `a` as metavariables, we could imagine
 * an instantiation of `a` with the expression `(* x 2)`.  No capture would
 * occur from the point of view of binding expressions, but capture would occur
 * from the point of view of the declaration of `x` at the start of the
 * environment, which functions conceptually like a binding.  This function
 * would return true in such a case, because capture of this type would occur.
 * 
 * Note that this function does *not* report on capture of the *other* type.
 * That is, it may be the case that, for some expression `E` inside the formula,
 * if we asked `E.isFreeToReplace(a,b)` where `b` is `(* x 2)`, we would get
 * false, but this function returns true, because it's not checking for capture
 * inside of expressions by a {@link BindingExpression}, but rather it is
 * checking only for capture that happens due to a declaration.

/**
 * Given a sequent and a formula, is there an instantiation of the formula that,
 * if added as another premise to the sequent, would make the sequent true?  The
 * answer to that question depends upon which deductive system is providing the
 * meaning of "true" for sequents, but in any reasonable case, finding exactly
 * the set of instantiations that would make a sequent true will typically be at
 * least as difficult as validating the instantiated sequent, perhaps moreso.
 * Consequently, this function does not attempt to find the exact correct answer
 * to that question, but rather finds a superset of the answer, guaranteeing
 * that any instantiation that would make the sequent hold will be among the
 * results.  Those results can be filtered further, if desired, by the client,
 * by running them through the validation algorithm for the deductive system in
 * play.
 * 
 * The default is to search for instantiations that will make the sequent true
 * when validated by {@link ValidationTools.classicalPropositionalValidator
 * classical propositional logic}.  However, if the client will be using
 * {@link ValidationTools.intuitionisticPropositionalValidator intuitionistic
 * propositional logic} instead, the results can be filterted further; simply
 * set `intuitionistic: true` in the options object.  This will not only return
 * fewer results, but also speed up the search for those results.
 * 
 * The default is to search for instantiations that will make the sequent true
 * even if the formula itself is only an intermediate step in a larger chain of
 * inferences.  However, it is often the case that the client wants the formula
 * to be the final step that achieves the sequent's conclusion (say, if a
 * student should be expected to cite a formula directly relevant to the
 * statement they're justifying).  This will significantly narrow the search
 * space and the result set and will consequently speed up the search.  Simply
 * set `direct: true` in the options object.
 * 
 * The default is to do the work silently, not generating any debugging output.
 * But if debugging a complex problem, it may help to see the inner workings of
 * this function.  Set `debug: true` in the options object to print copious
 * debugging output to the console.
 * 
 * This function is a generator that yields a sequence of objects in the same
 * format as those returned by {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations
 * allInstantiations()}; see its documentation for details.
 * 
 * @param {Sequent} sequent the sequent whose conclusion the client hopes to
 *   justify by instantiating the formula
 * @param {Formula} formula the formula whose possible instantiations are to be
 *   explored

 *   `{ direct: false, intuitionistic: false, debug: false }` and whose meaning
