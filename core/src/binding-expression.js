    /**
     * Construct a new BindingExpression instance from the given array of bound
     * variables (one or more {@link Symbol Symbols}) and body (required
     * {@link Expression}).  Recall from the documentation of the
     * {@link BindingInterface BindingInterface} that bindings do not contain an
     * operator, so {@link BindingExpression BindingExpressions} are almost
     * always wrapped in an application to add an operator to them.
     * 
     * For example, when encoding something like $\bigcup_i A_i$, the
     * documentation for {@link BindingInterface BindingInterface} gives the
     * following example way to do so.
     * 
     * ```js
     * new Application(
     *     new LurchSymbol( 'â‹ƒ' ),
     *     new BindingExpression(
     *         new LurchSymbol( 'i' ),
     *         new Application(
     *             new LurchSymbol( 'subscript' ),
     *             new LurchSymbol( 'A' ),
     *             new LurchSymbol( 'i' )
     *         )
     *     )
     * )
     * ```
     * 
     * As a second example, $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$, could be encoded as follows, if
     * we already had {@link Symbol Symbols} `i`, `n`, `Sum`, and `power`
     * defined.
     * 
     * ```
     * new Application(
     *     Sum, Symbol( 1 ), n,
     *     new BindingExpression( i, new Application( power, i, Symbol( 2 ) ) )
     * )
     * ```
     * 
     * Note that while it is possible later to remove children from a
     * BindingExpression so that it does not have the required structure of
     * symbols-then-body, this is almost certain to result in the members of
     * this class malfunctioning or throwing errors.  Clients should not remove
     * the necessary children of a BindingExpression; that is not supported.
     * 
     * Although it is unnecessarily to repeat the same variable twice on the
     * list of bound variables, we do not explicitly forbid it.
     * 
     * @param  {...Expression} args - the list of one or more
     *   {@link Symbol Symbols} that this expression binds, followed by its
     *   body, which must be of type {@link Expression Expression}.
     * @throws This constructor throws an error if any argument is not an
     *   {@link Expression Expressions}, or if any argument but the last is not
     *   a {@link Symbol Symbols}, or if the list of bound symbols is empty.
