/**
 * Many mathematical expressions are the application of some function or
 * operator to zero or (typically) more arguments.  For example $f(x)$ applies
 * the function $f$ to the argument $x$.  As another example, $17.2-p$ applies
 * the operation $-$ to the arguments $17.2$ and $p$.  We call such
 * expressions Applications, and implement them in this class.
 * 
 * These were inspired by a structure of the same name defined in
 * {@link https://openmath.org/about/ the OpenMath Standard}, but the reader
 * is not expected to read that standard; we define in this documentation our
 * version of what an Application is.
 * 
 * An Application is defined by a sequence of children, each of which is an
 * {@link Expression}.  The first such child will be the function or operator
 * that is applied to the rest of the children, and consequently, there must
 * always be at least one child of any Application.  The constructor defined
 * below requires this.
 * 
 * It is acceptable for there to be only one child, the function or operator
 * itself, and no other children.  Such functions are uncommon in mathematics,
 * but they are common in computer science.  For example, a function that
 * generates new pseudo-random numbers each time it is called is a function
 * that takes zero arguments.

     * Construct a new Application instance from the given operator (requried)
     * and list of operands (zero or more).  For example, to construct $f(x)$,
     * call `new Application(f,x)`, where we assume that `f` and `x` are
     * already defined elsewhere (perhaps as {@link Symbol Symbols}).  Or to
     * construct $17.2-p$, call `new Application(m,s,p)`, where `m` is the
     * subtraction operator, `s` is the constant $17.2$ and `p` is the
     * variable $p$.  Each of these three (`m`,`s`,`p`) would most likely be
     * an instance of the {@link Symbol} class.

     * Note that while it is possible later to remove children from an
     * Application until it has none, this is likely to result in the members
     * of this class malfunctioning or throwing errors.  Clients should not
     * remove the final child of an Application; that is not supported.
