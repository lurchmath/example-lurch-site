# The Lurch Core Classes

This subfolder is for the Lurch "core" classes, which include the primary data
structures for storing fundamental objects of syntax and semantics, such as
expressions, environments, and declarations.  These core classes also include
essential functionality for working with such classes, including the ability to
serialize/deserialize them to/from simple notations (e.g., JSON, putdown) and
tools for doing key operations on syntax trees, such as matching.

Other folders in this repository include code for the user interface and for the
validation algorithm.

Not all code and comments in this repository are 100% up-to-date; some are in
the process of being updated as we clean up from a major reorganization of our
codebase.
