            <h1>Example Lurch Site Landing Page</h1>
            <h2>What's a Lurch Site?</h2>
            <p>See <a href="http://lurchmath.github.io/site/what-is-a-lurch-site"
                >this page in our documentation</a> to learn about Lurch Sites.
                This page is part of an example Lurch Site to help you learn how
                to create your own such site.</p>
            <h2>What is this page?</h2>
            <p>Most Lurch Sites will want a landing page.  This page is a simple
                landing page, to show you how to create one.  Just place any
                <code>.html</code> file in the root folder of your Lurch Site
                repository.  You can even copy this one and use it as a starting
                point.  (Its code is online
                <a href="https://github.com/lurchmath/example-lurch-site/blob/main/index.html"
                >here</a>.)</p>
                <!-- If you copy this site, modify the URL above to contain your
                     GitHub username and repository name. -->
            <p>You can use just one file or many; it's up to you.  For more
                information on what's possible with GitHub static site hosting,
                <a href="">view their documentation</a>.</p>
            <h2>What should my pages contain?</h2>
            <p>Web pages in a Lurch Site typically do three things.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Describe the site, such as which course or audience it is
                    designed for, instructor contact information, etc.  How much
                    of this you do and in what style is totally up to you.</li>
                <li>Provide a link to the copy of the Lurch app that's hosted
                    within the site.  You do so with links like these:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="./app/"
                            >Lurch app in default (instructor) configuration</a></li>
                        <li><a href="./app/?config=default-student"
                            >Lurch app in student configuration</a></li>
                        <li><a href="./app/?config=minimal-instructor"
                            >Lurch app in minimal instructor configuration</a></li>
                        <li><a href="./app/?config=minimal-student"
                            >Lurch app in minimal student configuration</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Provide a link to open one or more of the mathematical
                    documents within the site, opening them in the copy of the
                    Lurch app that's hosted within the site.  We suggest putting
                    such files in
                    <a href="https://github.com/lurchmath/example-lurch-site/blob/main/math/"
                    >the <code>/math</code> folder</a> that's already been
                    created in this site for that purpose.  You can link to such
                    files as shown below.</li>
                    <!-- If you copy this site, modify the URL above to contain
                         your GitHub username and repository name. -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example link 1:
                            <a href="./app/?load=../math/PropositionalLogic.lurch"
                            >Rules for propositional logic</a></li>
                        <li>Example link 2:
                            <a href="./app/?load=../math/PropositionalProofs.lurch"
                            >A few uses of those rules in a proof</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The links in the above examples use the
                    <nobr><code>?config=</code></nobr> and
                    <nobr><code>?load=</code></nobr> query parameters.
                    You may combine those two parameters in the same URL, such as
                    <nobr><code>?config=X&amp;load=Y</code></nobr>.</li>
            </ol>
